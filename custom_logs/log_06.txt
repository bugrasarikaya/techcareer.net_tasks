"sl_db" database was exported by using "Right Click > Tasks > Export Data-tier Application..." path.
7 webpages [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] about authorization, were read.
Five videos [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] about authorization, were watched.
4 webpages [13] [14] [15] [16], were read.
A controller whose name is "AdminController" was created and "[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]" was added to it.
"Main" view  was moved to created "Admin" folder.
"app.UseAuthentication();" line was added into "Program.cs" file before "app.UseAuthorization();" line because it was read that authenticaiton must be before authorization line, on a webpage [17].
Server name was replaced with "." character in connection string which is in "ShoppingListDbContext.cs" file because another developer cannot run program without editing it.
A video [18] was watched.
By using some code lines from examined webpage [13], an authentication system was tried to be added but and error occured which has "InvalidOperationException: The provided identity of type 'System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity' is marked IsAuthenticated = true but does not have a value for Name. By default, the antiforgery system requires that all authenticated identities have a unique Name. If it is not possible to provide a unique Name for this identity, consider extending IAntiforgeryAdditionalDataProvider by overriding the DefaultAntiforgeryAdditionalDataProvider or a custom type that can provide some form of unique identifier for the current user." text.
After reading a webpage [19] briefly, problem was solved by adding more option to cookie.
Copied options were changed.
It was learnt that "HttpOnly" property which is assigned as "true", makes cookies only accessible on server-side, in two webpages [15].
Function of "SlidingExpiration" property was learnt on a webpage [21].
In console screen, a warning which has "warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionMiddleware[3] Failed to determine the https port for redirect." text, was noticed.
Warning was diseapeared after removing "app.UseHttpsRedirection();" line which had been used from a webpage [13], in "Program.cs".
Code of establishing ClaimIdentity, was polished by examining two webpages [22] [23].
"Index" action and "Index" view with their paths, were renamed as "Login".
"role" column was added by using model class and migration works.
"role" column of "admin" user was changed changed to "Admin" manually on SSMS.
"if-else "statement in "Login" action, was expanded by checking other all roles which are "Admin" and "User".
"UserController" class with a view, was created.
Second user which has "user" username, "54321" password and "User "role, was created on SSMS.
Title of "Main" views, were changed by adding its controller name.
Aplication was tested and it was observed that a bug was occurred.
While examining previous bug by using "breakpoint" and "quick watch", it was seen that value of "role" key, has multiple space character at ending.
For trying to resolve bug, textual column types were changed to "varchar".
After executing "add-migration migration_02" and then "update-base" commands, application was tested but same result was obtained.
While adding a record on "Register" view, an error was occured because of null role value.
After making "role" column nullable, "migration_03" was implemented and a dumb user was registered.
It was observed that new record has no redundant space characters.
Reduntant spaces of previous records and dumb record were deleted manually.
Application was tested and successful result was obtained.
Database was exported by overwriting.
