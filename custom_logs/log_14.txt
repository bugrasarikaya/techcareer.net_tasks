Design development process was started.
"_Layout.cshtml" was renamed as "_LayoutLogin.cshtml" and "Main" section was removed form its navigation bar.
"Shopping List" title was renamed to "Shopping List App".
After reading task instructions, changing "Account" model's content, was decided because some properties and validations were missing.

"email" and "password" types were set to input sections of login page.
A data annotation configuration from a webpage, was used for confirming password.
By benefiting 3 [2] [3] [4] webpages, validation of register page, was upgraded.

Register validation was completed.
"Register" hyperlink was changed to button.
"&emsp;" statement was found in a webpage [8].
Max length of string properties was increased to 100 and max length of small string properties was increased to 30.

Difference between "MaxLength" and "StringLength" data annotations, was learnt on a webpage [10].
A redirection to shopping list page from main page, was established because any simple main menu design idea could not be found.
Using "creation" word instead of "creating" word, was decided because it was more common in search results.
Button classes of Bootstrap, were examined on a webpage [11] and some of them was used.
While examining views, hyperlinks changed to button and some validation were added.
Parameter names of "Admin" controller, were changed for being more specific.
Table tag tutorial [12] of Bootstrap, was examined and applied.
"dt", "dl" and "dd" tags were examined on a webpage [13].
Thanks to "Display" attribute which was found in a webpage [14], table title names were not edited manually on every view.
"List<SelectListItem>" property could not be posted on submitting form by using hidden input.
Showed value which is password, could not be hidden and it was removed in details page.
Instead of using double "<br />" tag, one "<p>" tag was used on create buttons because it made buttons' locations more proper.
By benefiting 3 [15] [16] [17] webpages table style was changed and button were centered.
After reading briefly two webages [18] [19] about difference between "<div>" vs "<p>" tags, "<p>" tags were changed "<div>" tags.
