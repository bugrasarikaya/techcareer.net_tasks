"ShoppingList", "ShoppingProductList" and "ShoppingProduct" models were created.
Examined webpages [1] [2] [3] ,were examined again for remembering EF Core relationships.
A webpage [4] about "ICollection<T>" and "List<T>", was read and it was learnt that "ICollection<T>" is more general.
Although there are both "ICollection<T>" and "List<T>" usages in an official document [2], "ICollection<T>" was used in relationships of current application because its more general.
Meaning of "entity", which is like class, was remembered in seventh lecture record."
"AccountName" column was renamed as "Name".
CS0308 error occurred while trying to write a many-to-one relationship between "ShoppingProductList" and "ShoppingProduct" and it was resolved by changing relationship direction.
A new property whose type is "ICollection<ShoppingProduct>?" was added to "Product" model for making a relationship with "ShoppingProduct" class and "ProductConfiguration" class was updated.
After aplying "ShoppingListConfiguration", "ShoppingProductListConfiguration" and "ShoppingProductConfiguration" configuration classes, seventh migration was implemented but an unintended relationship which is like that both two tables has foreign key, was occured.
Unintended relationship was fixed by editing "ShoppingListConfiguration" class.
"update-database migration_07> command which is found in a webpage [5] was used to revert database and then seventh migration was removed.
A new seventh migration was applied but inintended relationship continued to exist and it was ignored.
"Shopping" actions and views were started to be created.
Actions' locations in controller, were changed as alphabetical order.
"RemoveRange" method was found in a webpage [6] and it was used for removing multiple rows.
It was observed that "Remove" and "RemoveRange" methods did not give an error while requesting to delete row which are not exists.
"ShoppingProduct" model with its configurations, was removed because it was considered unnecessary.
A webpage [7] was read briefly for learning possibility of a relationship which is among two tables both referring one another.
CS1061 error was occured while trying to make many-to-many relationship.
Error could not be resolved and relationship was changed to one-to-many relationship.
Eighth migration was applied.
On SSMS diagram, it was observed that all relationship lines have two yellow keys and it was ignored.
"ShoppingListProductImageViewModel" ViewModel was created.
2 webpagse [8] [9] and fifth lecture record were examined for remembering difference between "ViewData", "ViewBag", "TempData".
"FormCollection" type was found in a webpage [10] and it was considered to be used for trying to post different data like different model, with HTML form.
"ShoppingListProductImageViewModel" class was renamed as "ShoppingListProductViewModel" and its properties were reduced to store only primary key values of "ShoppingList" and "Product" models.
"ProductList" view was copied and renamed as "ShoppingProductAdd".
Instead of using an HTML link, a form which has two hidden inputs, was used to post "ShoppingListProductViewModel" values in "ShoppingProductAdd" view and "ShoppingListID" value was obtained from ViewData.
"ShoppingProductListID" property in "ShoppingList" model was removed.
"ShoppingProductList" model was renamed as "ShoppingProduct".
Changed models' configurations were edited and ninenth migration was applied.
"ShoppingListProductViewModel" class was renamed as "ShoppingListProductIDViewModel" and a new "ShoppingListProductViewModel" class was created to store necessary properties of "ShoppingList", "ShoppingProduct" and "Product" models.
After getting setting "ShoppingListProductViewModel" values with LINQ operations, "ShoppingListDetails" view was re-created by using scoffholder with "List" template.
"First" method which gets first element of IEnumerable model, was found in a webpage [11].
An implementation for posting a form with different model, did not worked.
Using partial view, method was tried by benefiting a document [12].
CS8605 warning occured while assigning and unboxing ViewData value in creating a model and it was resolved adding a null-forgiving operator by benefiting a document [13].
Partial view method worked and a new product was added into shopping list but "ShoppingListDetails" view became inaccessible because of an Entity Framework error which is about duplicate key.
To resolve previous problem relationship lines were commented and tenth migration was applied.
For using "RedirectToAction" method with paramater, an anonymous object was created and used by benefiting a webpage [14].
An error occured in an implementation of "RemoveRange" and "Select" methods and it was resolved by using "Where" method which was found in a webpage [15].
An "if-else" statement was added into "_ShoppingListProductIDViewModel" partial view for using it in different views but then it was commented because a simpler method which is using link tag helper, was used.
Deleting operations was coded successfully.
Database was exported.
