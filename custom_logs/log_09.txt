Height and weight values of image on HTML, were changed by using "height" HTML attribute which was found in a webpage [1].
"ProductImageViewModel" file with its necessary properties and its "Detail" view, were created.
"Detail" action was created and coded.
"ProductEdit" view was created by scaffholding and it was observerd that input blanks were filled without using "value" HTML attribute.
Difference between "Update" and "SaveChanges" method, was remembered in seventh lecture record and "SaveChanges" was used for editing product.
"OriginalProductID" and "OriginalImageID" properties were added to "ProductImageViewModel" class because it was thought that previous values of ID columns were necessary before editing.
Original ID values were passed with hidden HTML input which was remembered in a webpage [2].
ID columns could not be changed and then it was learnt that changing primary columns, are not allowed, in 2 webpages [3] [4].
Primary key edition inputs were removed and ID values were passed by using hidden HTML input.
Dumb inputs were entered and then changed values were seen.
A method about pre-filling image file in "ProductEdit" view, was tried to be found but it was learnt that it is not allowed too, in a webpage [5].
From previous webpage [5], a suggestion to remove validation and keep image same if its null, was applied and it was worked.
"ProductDelete" action was created and product deletion was implemented by using "remove" method which is found in a webpage [6].
"Product" word was added on the left side of some actions and views to prevent conflicting with "user" actions and views.
"AddProduct" actions and views were renamed as "ProductAdd".
"Products" actions and views were renamed as "ProductList".
